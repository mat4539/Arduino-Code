Oh, Oh, Gang

I gotta let the beat write off for a little bit, ya know
Get some excitement rolling

I been getting fuckin' throat with yo bitch
Ain't no chrome on my hip

Fly out to Madrid and pour sangria on some tits
Ay, ay

[Chorus]
Coffee on my Jordans (ooh)

Pull up on yo bitch like I'm Billy Bob Thornton (ooh, ooh)
Yeah I'm cruisin' in that foreign
That's the Honda Civic and its got yo bitch pourin'

In that Coogi sweater I was lookin' fuckin' dapper
So I pull up on yo bitch in that white Velociraptor (Woah)

Pull up on yo bitch like I'm Billy Bob Thornton (ooh, ooh)
